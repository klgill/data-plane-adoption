= {Ceph} daemon cardinality

{Ceph} 6 and later applies strict constraints in the way daemons can be
colocated within the same node.

The resulting topology depends on the available hardware, as well as the amount
of {Ceph} services present in the Controller nodes that are going to be
retired.
As a general rule, the number of services that can be migrated depends on the
number of available nodes in the cluster. The following diagrams cover the
distribution of the {Ceph} daemons on the {Ceph} nodes where at least three
nodes are required in a scenario that includes only RGW and RBD, without the
{Ceph} Dashboard:

|    |                     |             |
|----|---------------------|-------------|
| osd | mon/mgr/crash      | rgw/ingress |
| osd | mon/mgr/crash      | rgw/ingress |
| osd | mon/mgr/crash      | rgw/ingress |
----

With the {dashboard_service}, and without {rhos_component_storage_file_first_ref}, at
least 4 nodes are required. The {Ceph} dashboard has no failover:

| osd | rgw/ingress   | (free)            |

With the {Ceph} dashboard and the {rhos_component_storage_file}, 5 nodes
minimum are required, and the {Ceph} dashboard has no failover:
